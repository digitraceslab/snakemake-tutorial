MissingOutputException in rule resample in file /scratch/work/luongn1/snakemake-tutorial/workflow/Snakefile, line 17:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/interim/study_A/call_hourly.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: call_duration.csv)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
